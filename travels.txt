I cannot pick a favorite trip because I love traveling so much. I enjoy
traveling out of the country as well as domestic. I had the pleasure of
working on a team that was replacing a legacy system, so, I got to travel
all over the U.S. at the expense of my company. My last trip took me to
Amsterdam, eastern France, Paris, and London. I spent 2 and half weeks
with a good friend. This of course was last year when we, U.S. citizens,
could actually travel to Europe. We had a splendid time!
